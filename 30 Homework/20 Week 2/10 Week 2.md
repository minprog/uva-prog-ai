# Homework Week 2

The homework for this week consists of the following lectures and chapters from
*Think Java*. You are required to mark all sections that you find hard to
understand. You must also write down any questions that pop-up during reading.

## Before the first lab session

* Lecture 8 & 9.
* Chapters 2, 3, 4.1 -- 4.7, 6.1 -- 6.7, 7, and 9 from *Think Java*.

## Before the second lab session

* Lecture 10 & 11.

You must bring the syllabus with your notes to each lab session. We will check
what you've read and will talk about the questions you have.

You are strongly encourage to read the chapters again during the week, because
these may not make sense immediately without practice.
