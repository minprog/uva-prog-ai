## Installation with VMware Fusion on Mac

Download VMware Fusion as follows by [clicking this link](https://www.vmware.com/go/tryfusion).

Double-click the file you just downloaded (which is likely in your **Downloads** folder) in order to "mount" VMware Fusion’s icon on your desktop.

A window should open. Drag the **VMware Fusion** (or **VMware Fusion.app**) icon in that window to your **Applications** folder.

Download the Appliance itself at <http://mprog.uvastudent.org/CSUvA_vmware.ova>. That file is over 1GB in size, so it might take a while to download.

Once the file has finished downloading, check whether its name ends in `.ova` or `.ovf`. There appears to be a bug in Chrome whereby `.ova` is incorrectly changed to `.ovf`, so if the file's name does now end in `.ovf`, change it back as follows:

* Single-click the file.
* Hit Enter.
* Change `.ovf` to `.ova`.
* Hit Enter.

Next, launch VMware Fusion, as by double-clicking its icon, which should be in your **Applications** folder. If prompted with a Software License Agreement, click **Agree**. If prompted to provide a license, select the 30-day trial instead. If prompted to Create New, Convert VM, or Migrate PC, simply click **Skip**.

Ensure that you have the latest version of VMware Fusion, as by selecting VMware Fusion &rarr; **Check for Updates...**. Update and relaunch VMware Fusion as needed.

Select File &rarr; **Import...**. Navigate your way to that appliance50-19-vmware.ova file (which is probably still in Downloads) and select it.

Click VMware Fusion's **▶** button to start the appliance. If prompted to "upgrade this virtual machine," click **Upgrade**.

The appliance should then boot! If you see a black-and-white screen entitled GNU GRUB, no need to do anything; the appliance will continue to boot after a few seconds!
