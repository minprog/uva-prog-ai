# Quiz

During the quiz, you are allowed to use one (1) sheet of A4 paper containing
written or typed notes on any subject, and a pen, nothing else.

You are to write your solutions on paper, in pseudocode or in real Java(TM),
and you do not need to remember or specify which libraries to `import` to use
special functions. You can use any library that is used in problem sets 1--5.
Any external methods you use must actually exist, of course!

## Sample questions

- [Section 5](section5.pdf) ([solutions](section5sol.pdf)) Files, arrays, arraylists
- [Section 6](section6.pdf) ([solutions](section6sol.pdf)) Arrays and Hashmap
- [Additional](add.pdf) ([solutions](addsol.pdf)) Strings, graphics, random, arrays
